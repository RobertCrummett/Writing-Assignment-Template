## About Writing-Assignment
This repo is for basic writing assigments I want to complete in LaTeX. The format is simple, but useful for quickly getting started.

## Configure
To use this template,
- Download a .zip file of the main directory.
- Unzip the directory.
- Inside there should be two `rename-*` scripts. Both scripts take one argument, the new name of the the writing assignment. Choose the script suitable for your operating system.
- Upon being executed, the `rename-*` script will rename the `writing-assignment.tex` file and then delete itself.
- Now you should only have the renamed `*.tex` file in your current directory. _Get going on that writing!_
